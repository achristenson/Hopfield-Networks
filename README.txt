Brief Primer on Hopfield Networks

In 1982 J.J. Hopfield wrote his seminal paper "Neural networks and 
physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities."
This paper was considered highly important at the time of publication.
It helped spur an increase in artificial intelligence research and has
recieved nearly 20,000 citations since publication.

His original paper draws comparisons between the computational
properties of biological organisms and the construction of computers.
These come primarily by comparing the function of a neuron in a brain
with the function of a transistor in a computer.
